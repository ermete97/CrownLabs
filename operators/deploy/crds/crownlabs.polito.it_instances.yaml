                description: Whether the current instance is running or not. The meaning
                  of this flag is different depending on whether the instance refers
                  to a persistent environment or not. If the first case, it allows
                  to stop the environment (e.g. the underlying VM) without deleting
                  the associated disk. Setting the flag to true will restart the environment,
                  attaching it to the same disk used previously. Differently, if the
                  environment is not persistent, it only tears down the exposition
                  objects, making the instance effectively unreachable from outside
                  the cluster, but allowing the subsequent recreation without data
                  loss.
